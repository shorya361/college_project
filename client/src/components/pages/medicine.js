                HEADACHE
                </h2>
                <li>
                A Headache is defined as a pain in the head or upper neck. It is one of the most common
locations of pain in the body and has many causes. There are three major categories of
headaches:
<ol>
<li> Primary headaches</li>
<li> Secondary headaches </li>
<li> Cranial neuralgias, facial pain, and other headaches</li>
Assessment of headache should be comprehensive for example to include
<li>Age at onset</li>
<li> Presence or absence of aura and prodrome</li>
<li> Frequency, intensity and duration of attack</li>
<li> Number of headache days per month</li>
<li> Quality, site, and radiation of pain</li>
<li> Associated symptoms and abnormalities</li>
</ol>
<h3>Primary headache</h3> 
Primary headaches include migraine, tension, and cluster headaches, as well as a variety of
other less common types of headache
Migraine Headache
This is characterized by a trial of paroxysmal headache, vomiting and focal neurological events
(usually visual). It is more common in females than in males often there is a family history of
migraine.
Associated precipitants include:-
<li> Dietary (cheese, chocolate or red wine)</li>
<li> Psychological stress</li>
<h4>General Measures</h4>
<li>Avoidance of precipitants</li>
<li> Relaxation to reduce stress</li>
Medicines
In acute attack give analgesics:
<ol>
<li> Paracetamol 1g immediately then every 4 hours; Max 4g per day</li>
<li> Aspirin 600mg, repeat after 4 hours if needed.</li>
<li> Metroclopramide oral/IM, 10 mg 3 times daily.</li>
In severe attack give:
<li> Ergotamine tartrate 1-2 mg, maximum 4mg in 24hours, not to be repeated at
intervals less than 4 days.</li>
For prevention purposes give:
<li> Propranolol 80-160mg daily</li>
<li> Amitryptiline 10-50mg at night.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tension headaches</h3>
While tension headaches are the most frequently occurring type of headache, the cause is most
likely contraction of the muscles that cover the skull. When the muscles covering the skull are
stressed, they may spasm and cause pain. Common sites include the base of the skull, the 

temple and the forehead. Tension headaches occur because of physical or emotional stress
placed on the body.
Diagnosis
<li> The pain begins in the back of the head and upper neck and is described as a band-like
tightness or pressure.</li>
<li> Often is described as pressure encircling the head with the most intense pressure over
the eyebrows.</li>
<li> The pain usually is mild (not disabling) and bilateral (affecting both sides of the head).</li>
<li> The pain is not associated with an aura (see below), nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to
light and sound.</li>
<li> The pain occurs sporadically (infrequently and without a pattern) but can occur
frequently and even daily in some people.</li>
<li> The pain allows most people to function normally, despite the headache.</li>

Treatment
Tension headaches are painful, and patients may be upset that the diagnosis is "only" a tension
headache. Even though it is not life-threatening, a tension headache can affect the activities of
daily life. The following work well for most people:
<ol>
<li>Aspirin (300-900mg (O) every 4-6 hrs max 4g daily)</li>

<li> Ibuprofen (1.2-1.8g daily in 3-4 divided doses preferably after food max dose
2.4g daily, maintenance dose of 0.6-1.2g daily may be adequate.)</li>
<li> Paracetamol 1g (O) 8hrly</li>
<li> Naproxen 0.5-1g in 1-2 divided daily doses</li></ol>
Massage, and stress management can all be used as adjuncts to tension headaches. When pain medications are used for a prolonged period of time, headaches can recur as
the effects of the medication wear off. Thus, the headache becomes a symptom of the
withdrawal of medication (rebound headache).
<h3>Cluster headaches</h3>
Cluster headaches are headaches that come in groups (clusters) lasting weeks or months,
separated by pain-free periods of months or years. The cause of cluster headaches is uncertain.
Some evidence shows that brain scans performed on patients who are in the midst of a cluster
headache, shows abnormal activity in the hypothalamus. Cluster headaches:

<li> May tend to run in families and this suggests that there may be a genetic role</li>
<li> May be triggered by changes in sleep patterns</li>
<li> May be triggered by medications (for example, nitroglycerin)</li>
If an individual is in a susceptible period for cluster headache, cigarette smoking, alcohol, and
some foods (for example, chocolate) also can be potential causes for headache.
Diagnosis</li>
<li> Pain typically occurs once or twice daily and last for 30 to 90 minutes</li>
<li> Attacks tend to occur at about the same time every day</li>
<li> The pain typically is excruciating and located around or behind one eye. The affected
eye may become red, inflamed, and watery</li>

Treatment
<ol>
<li> Sumatriptan 6mg; Dose may be repeated after 1 hour. Max dose 12mg a day</li>
<li> 100% Oxygen at the rate of 10-15L/min for 10-20 minutes</li>
Prevention of the next cluster headache may include the following:
<li> Verapamil 240-960mg (O) 8 -12 hourly divided doses</li>
<li>Amitryptiline 25-50 mg (O) daily</li>
</ol>
Prevention cluster headaches
Since cluster headache episodes may be spaced years apart, and since the first headache of a
new cluster episode can't be predicted, daily medication may not be warranted.
Lifestyle changes may help minimize the risk of a cluster headache flare. Stopping smoking and
minimizing alcohol may prevent future episodes of cluster headache.

<h3>Secondary headache</h3>
Secondary headaches are due to an underlying disease or injury that needs to be diagnosed
and treated. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential if damage is to be limited
Examples of Secondary headache:
<li> Head and neck trauma</li>
<li> Blood vessel problems in the head and neck</li>
<h4>Medications and drugs </h4>
<ol>
<li> Malaria</li>
<li> Meningitis</li>
<li> Encephalitis</li>
<li> HIV/AIDS</li>
<li> Systemic infections</li>
</ol>
<h4>Diagnosis</h4>
<li> If there is time, the diagnosis of secondary headache begins with a complete patient
history followed by a physical examination and laboratory and radiology tests as
appropriate</li>
<li> However, some patients present in crisis with a decreased level of consciousness or
unstable vital signs. In these situations, the health care practitioner may decide to treat
a specific cause without waiting for tests to confirm the diagnosis</li>

of the tracheobronchial system. It may be dry or productive sputum. Cough may be
paroxysmal, hacking, explosive, and harsh (brassy).
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Causative/precipitating factors e.g. CCF, asthma; allergies must be established and treated
accordingly. Where causative/precipitating factors cannot be detected, the following treatments
may be offered:
For Non-productive irritating cough-

<li> Cough syrup/Linctus (O) 5-10 ml every 6 hours</li>

                Shock is a life threatening condition characterized by hypotension. If not treated immediately it
leads to death.
<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
<li> Low blood pressure (systolic BP below 80 mmHg) is the key sign of shock</li>

<li> Rapid and shallow breathe</li>
<li> Restlessness and altered mental state</li>
<li> Weakness</li>
<li> Low urine output</li>
Note
Signs and symptoms of shock in children must be recognized while still in the compensated
state to avoid irreversible deterioration. Therefore, the following are primarily assessed in
children:
<ol>
<li> Prolonged capillary filling (more than 3 seconds)</li>
<li> Decreased pulse volume (weak thread pulse)</li>
<li> Increased heart rate (>160/minute in infants, > 120 in children)</li>
<li> Decreased level of consciousness (poor eye contact)</li>
<li> Rapid breathing</li>
<li>Decreased blood pressure and decreased urine output are late signs and while they can
be monitored the above signs are more sensitive in detecting shock before irreversible.</li></ol>

                HYPOGLYCEMIA
                </h2>
                <li>
                Hypoglycemia is a condition of lower than normal level of blood glucose.
Criteria referred to as Whipple's triad are used to determine a diagnosis of hypoglycemia:
1. Symptoms known to be caused by hypoglycemia
2. Low glucose at the time the symptoms occur
3. Reversal or improvement of symptoms or problems when the glucose is restored to
normal
Symptoms of hypoglycemia usually do not occur until the blood sugar is in the level of 2.8 to
3.0 mmol/L (50 to 54 mg/dl). The precise level of glucose considered low enough to define
hypoglycemia is dependent on (1) the measurement method, (2) the age of the person, (3)
presence or absence of effects, and (4) the purpose of the definition.
Signs and symptoms
Hypoglycemic symptoms and manifestations can be divided into those produced by the counter
regulatory hormones (epinephrine/adrenaline and glucagon) triggered by the falling glucose,
and the neuroglycopenic effects produced by the reduced brain sugar.
Adrenergic manifestations
<ol>
<li> Shakiness, anxiety, nervousness</li>
<li> Palpitations, tachycardia</li>
<li> Sweating, feeling of warmth (although sweat glands have muscarinic receptors, thus
"adrenergic manifestations" is not entirely accurate)</li>
<li> Pallor, coldness, clamminess</li>
<li> Dilated pupils (mydriasis)</li>
Feeling of numbness "pins and needles" (paresthesia)
Glucagon manifestations
<li> Hunger, borborygmus</li>
<li> Nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort</li>
<li> Headache</li>
</ol>

<h3>Causes</h3>
The circumstances of hypoglycemia provide most of the clues to diagnosis. Circumstances
include the age of the patient, time of day, time since last meal, previous episodes, nutritional
status, physical and mental development, drugs or toxins (especially insulin or other diabetes
drugs), diseases of other organ systems, family history, and response to treatment. When
hypoglycemia occurs repeatedly, a record or "diary" of the spells over several months, noting
the circumstances of each spell (time of day, relation to last meal, nature of last meal, response
to carbohydrate, and so forth) may be useful in recognizing the nature and cause of the
hypoglycemia.
Glucose requirements above 10 mg/kg/minute in infants, or 6 mg/kg/minute in children and
adults are strong evidence for hyperinsulinism. In this context this is referred to as the glucose
infusion rate (GIR).
Finally, the blood glucose response to glucagon given when the glucose is low can also help
distinguish among various types of hypoglycemia. A rise of blood glucose by more than
30 mg/dl (1.70mmol/l) suggests insulin excess as the probable cause of the hypoglycemia.
For patients who have recurrent hypoglycemia’s the following tests might be needed depending
on the history and physical examination: insulin, cortisol, and electrolytes, with C-peptide and
drug screen for adults and growth hormone in children.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Management of hypoglycemia involves immediately raising the blood sugar to normal,
determining the cause, and taking measures to hopefully prevent future episodes.
The blood glucose can be raised to normal within minutes by taking 10-20 grams of
carbohydrate. It can be taken as food or drink if the person is conscious and able to swallow.
This amount of carbohydrate is contained in about 100-120 ml of orange juice or non-diet soda.
Starch is quickly digested to glucose (unless the person is taking acarbose), but adding fat or
protein retards digestion. Symptoms should begin to improve within 5 minutes, though full 

recovery may take 10–20 minutes. Overfeeding does not speed recovery and if the person has
diabetes will simply produce hyperglycemia afterwards.
If unconscious or for other reasons can not feed orally secure an IV line and give intravenous
dextrose, concentrations varying depending on age (infants are given 2 ml/kg dextrose 10%,
children are given dextrose 25%, and adults are given dextrose 50%). Care must be taken in
giving these solutions because they can be very necrotic if the IV is infiltrated. If an IV cannot
be established, the patient can be given 1 to 2 milligrams of glucagon in an intramuscular
injection.
One situation where starch may be less effective than glucose or sucrose is when a person is
taking acarbose. Since acarbose and other alpha-glucosidase inhibitors prevents starch and
other sugars from being broken down into monosaccharide’s that can be absorbed by the body,
patients taking these medications should consume monosaccharide-containing foods such as
glucose powder, honey, or juice to reverse hypoglycemia.
(For other details, refer to Hypoglycemia, under Endocrine and Metabolic Disease
conditions’ chapter thirteen)

                <li>
Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound heard near the end of expiration. It is caused by
spasmodic narrowing of the distal airways. Sometimes children with pneumonia present with
wheeze.
In a young infant below 3 months, wheezing is a sign of serious illness - REFER IMMEDIATELY
to a higher level if the condition cannot be managed at your facility.
Wheezing for infants between 3 and 12 months may be due to bronchiolitis, a viral infection –
REFER to a higher level if the condition cannot be managed at your facility . 

In Children more than 1 year wheezing may be due to asthma, refer to section on asthma. If
the child is in distress, give a rapid-acting bronchodilator (see section on asthma) and REFER to
a higher level if the condition cannot be managed at your facility.
<h3>General management</h3>
<li> If the child has fever (>39
o C) give Paracetamol</li>
<li> Give Oxygen to all children with wheezing and severe respiratory distress</li>
<li> Give daily maintenance fluids appropriate for the child’s age</li>
<li> Encourage breast-feeding & oral fluids</li>
<li> Encourage the child to eat as soon as food can be eaten</li>
<h3>
Treatment</h3>
Bronchodialator in Children 1-5 years
If a rapid acting bronchodilator is required drugs of choice:Adrenaline (1:1000) 0.01
ml/kg body weight by subcutaneous (SC) injection up to maximum of 0.25 ml may be
repeated after 20 minutes.
Oral bronchodilator (for Children 1-5 years) Salbutamol (O) 0.4 mg/kg/day divided in 3-4 doses
for 5 days.

 During paroxysms of coughing, place the child head down and prone, or on the side, to
prevent any inhaling of vomitus and to aid expectoration of secretions.
 Care for the airway but avoid, as far as possible, any procedure that could trigger coughing,
such as application of suction, throat examination
 Do not give cough suppressants, sedatives, mucolytic agents or anti-histamines.
 If the child has fever (>38.50C) give paracetamol.
 Encourage breastfeeding or oral fluids
 Whooping cough is preventable by immunization with pertussis vaccine contained in DPT
triple vaccine.
 Admit infants aged less than 6 months to hospital; also admit any child with pneumonia,
convulsions, dehydration, severe malnutrition, or prolonged apnoea or cyanosis after
coughing.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<ol>
<li> Erythromycin 12.5 mg/kg (PO) every 6 hours for 10 days.</li>

<li>Chloramphenicol 25 mg/kg (PO) every 8 hours for 5 days</li>
<li>Oxygen
Give oxygen to children who have spells of apnoea or cyanosis, or severe paroxysms of
coughing.</li>
<li>
 Use nasal prongs, not a nasopharyngeal catheter or nasal catheter which can provoke
coughing. </li>

It is the inflammation of the hair follicle. The most common forms are caused by invasive
staphylococcus but other bacteria, viruses, and fungi may also be responsible. Other forms
(eosinophilic folliculitis in HIV/AIDS) are non infectious. Mechanical irritation is also a factor,
such as prolonged sitting. Deep follicular inflammation often occurs in the bearded areas of the
face (Sycosis barbae).

                <li>
                 
It is a chronic fungal infection determined by the nature of the dermatophyte, by the tissue it
invades i.e. skin, hair or nails and by the degree of host response. Infections with
dermatophytes are usually called tinea; for further description, the anatomical site is added.
The clinical infection usually starts from an innoculation site and spreads peripherally hence the
annular lesions with an active border. In non medical jargon, the diagnosis is often known as
“ringworm”. It is sometimes accompanied by loss of hair, itching and pustules.
<h3>Tinea Corporis (Body Ringworm)</h3>
Annular, expanding lesions with central healing and distinct borders on the body or face. A fine
scale may be present.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Drug of choice
 <li>Compound benzoic acid (Whitfield’s ointment) applied two times a day for up
to 4 weeks.</li>
<li>
Second choice:
 Clotrimazole cream1% applies thinly two times a day, continue for 5 to 7 days
after clearing of lesions
OR
Miconazole cream 2%, and apply thinly two times a day. Continue for 5-7
days after clearing of lesions.</li>
<h3> Tinea Capitis (Scalp Ringworm)</h3>

Scabies is an intensely pruritic and highly contagious infestation of the skin caused by a mite
Sarcoptes scabie burrowing into the skin; affecting humans and other animals.The main clinical
features are, a short elevated serpiginous (S-shaped) track in the superficial epidermis, known
as a burrow, this is pathognomonic of a scabies infestation. A small vesicle or papule may
appear at the end of the burrow or occur independently. Norwegian scabies presents with
extensive crusting (psoriasiformlike lesions) of the skin with thick, hyperkeratotic scales
overlying the elbows, knees, palms, and soles.
