                        The Inter-connected Healthcare System is designed to allow easy and protected access to the patient's medical record to provide the doctor the entire information at one place when making a diagnosis and plan of treatment.</p>
                    <p className={classes.paragraph_content}>
                         Using this system, the medical records can be updated with ease as and when any new information is collected by either the patient or the health care provider.</p>
                    <p className={classes.paragraph_content}>
                        This record of medical history can then be made available without any difficulty when it is required. 
                    </p>
                    <p className={classes.paragraph_content}>
                        In this way, a network of healthcare is established that allows rapid examination of the patient and preliminary evaluation of needs using several data sources that are effectively made available at one place.</p>
                    <p className={classes.paragraph_content}>
                        It would be easier for the doctors in charge to start the appropriate treatment if they know the patientâ€™s medical history for instance information about any previous medications or surgeries, past injuries, allergies etc.</p>
                    <p className={classes.paragraph_content}> 
                        Even primary details like blood group, most recent report of tests like Complete Blood Count, X-ray, MRI etc. can prove to be abundantly useful and prevent any unnecessary repetitions of such medical tests.</p>
                    <p className={classes.paragraph_content}> 
                        Therefore, a system is required which can encompass the complete medical history of an individual at a single space and which can be retrieved when needed from any location.
